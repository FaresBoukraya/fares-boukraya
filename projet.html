                <h2>What is an Operating System?</h2>
                <p>An Operating System (OS) is the crucial software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware, making it possible for applications to run.</p>
                <p>Think of it as the conductor of an orchestra, ensuring all the different parts (hardware and software) work together harmoniously.</p>

                <h2>Key Functions of an OS</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Process Management:</strong> Allocating and managing CPU time for different programs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Controlling and coordinating computer memory, assigning space to programs.</li>
                    <li><strong>File Management:</strong> Organizing and managing files and directories.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Management:</strong> Communicating with and controlling peripheral devices (printers, keyboards, etc.).</li>
